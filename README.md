## How to use

Prepare your APIKEY with Infura.

1. look at the chart and look for smart degen play.
2. use EtherScan to download DEX trades for the specified time period for the token you want to investigate, to see if there are actually traders who have made that play.
3. paste all buy addresses into /input/buy_hash.py and all sell addresses into sell_hash.py.
4. run main.py
